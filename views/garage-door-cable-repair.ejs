                                        Garage doors operate through the precisely accurate operation of springs and cables - and broken garage door cables can not only render garage doors unuseable, they pose great danger - as they can cause heavy garage doors to crash down suddenly.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When garage door cables are overused or misaligned they often snap or break - and should only be repaired by licensed and experienced experts. The team of technicians at WestSide Garage Door & Gates have the skills to restore your garage door cables to good-as-new condition in an efficient and professional manner - and always for a fair and budget friendly rate.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Amateurs should NEVER attempt to repair their garage door cables themselves, as it can pose serious danger.
