                                        Garage door springs operate under huge amounts of weight and tension - and the slightest issue with your garage door springs not only affects the operation of your garage doors, but causes garage doors to become potentially dangerous - running the risk of crashing down if a spring snaps or breaks.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Amateurs should NEVER attempt to repair garage door springs themselves because of this danger; but luckily, the experts here at WestSide Garage Door & Gates remain on-call, 24/7 to provide our clients with speedy and convenient garage door spring repair service.
